# fuzzy-controller
a fuzzy distance controller for a following vehicle in a bidirectional movement space. This is a simple test to demonstrate the mechanics of such a controller. The driving behaviour and the current distance are taken into account. Further components can be easily added. The output variable is the adjustment of the speed.
